# logistic-regression
It's a Diabetes prediction system I've built using Logistic Regression. It predicts if a certain individual can have diabetes based on some input parameters, such as BMI, Glucose Level etc. I've evaluated the performance of the model using Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score, F1 Score and Confusion Matrix.
